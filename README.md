# Protect the Cylinder

### You are a blue orb surrounded on all sides by green walls. You are stuck inside a small enclosure with some colorful trees, and some dome like rocks. There are red cubes all around you that have malicious intent, and seem to be headed towards a golden cylinder that you feel obligated to protect.
